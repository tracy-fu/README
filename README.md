# README-TECHxJAZZ

This is a discussion about how technology can impact the music community.

### Proposal

A piece of tech that can accurately transcribe jazz solos in music.

### Sidenote (to clear a few things up)

**What is jazz music?**

A musical genre characterised by improvisation and originating from African-American communities, with roots in blues and ragtime.

**What is transcribing?**

Transcribing means writing down what you hear when you listen to a piece of music, and writing it in musical notation.

**Why jazz solos?**

As jazz is an improvised music, the solos are filled with a blend of emotion and technicality in varying proportions. Jazz is also infamous for its difficulty, therefore lowering the skill ceiling could be seen as desirable. Transciptions allow us to understand the thought processes behind a good solo to then learn from it and play better solos ourselves.

### Motivation

As a jazz musician myself, transcribing music has always been something I have found challenging, especially in jazz soloing (some of the greats being notoriously difficult to play). 

Therefore, why not allow technology to help out?

### Community Goal

To bring fellow jazzers of all ages/skill level/gender/race/background/class together through a shared interest of developing one's musicianship. The more transcriptions learnt and shared, the more people can be reached to grow the community.

### Community Impact (Debate)

Anyone who transcribes, at one point, has wished there was a machine to do it for them. Something like this would be a positive piece of tech, but only when you have the discipline not to use it. Transcribing is an iterative process - lots of listening, writing, playing, and repeat. Tech like this would kill the process which in itself has huge learning potential, therefore for learning purposes, it could be frowned upon by the community. It's up to the discretion of the user: tech like this could be incredibly useful in short timeframe scenarios, but if it is used 24/7 then that would only self-sabotage one's own learning. 

In order for this to have a positive impact on the community, it is down to the user to be responsible themselves.

### Thoughts for the future

Very possible to expand the community to include other genres of music.

Links between technology and willpower - is the community strong enough to resist the convenience of technology?
